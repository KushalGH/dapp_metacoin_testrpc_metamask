# dapp_metacoin_testrpc_metamask

	This is the basic structure for configuring an DAPP. This structure I have copied from my dapp_ethereum_mainet_task_mgmt repository.


# Development Environment
    
    - nodeJS version -- ^8.11.2 ( nodejs -v ) 
    - npm version -- 5.6.0 (npm -v)     
    - git -- 2.13.2 (git --version)
    - operating system -- windows 
    - testrpc -- 6.0.3 -- if you get the addresses then, it means your testrpc is installed in your system (if not installed: npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc)
    - truffle -- @4.1.13 --It is the framework which is used to develop the ethereum DAPP (if not installed -- npm install -g truffle)
    - visual studio code editor -- (install solidity plugin using https://davidburela.wordpress.com/2016/11/18/configuring-visual-studio-code-for-ethereum-blockchain-development/)
    - metamask for chrome extension


    (note: for windows user, please run these commands in powershell in admin mode. We don't have a concept of sudo in windows, sudo is nothing but the admin mode in windows)    

    - To get Ethers in Test Rospten network
        - ropsten faucet (https://faucet.metamask.io/)


# Building the structure for DAPP

    (note: Please run these commands at the project location)
    - mkdir taskdapp
    - cd taskdapp
    - truffle unbox webpack -- creating the basic structure of DAPP (truffle unbox webpack)
                            -- migration files will migrate to Ethereum network
                            -- truffle js - Contains all the default truffle settings
    - testrpc (note: run in new powershell in admin mode)
    - truffle compile or truffle.cmd compile 
        - (note: Please run these commands at the project location)
        - (note: for windows user, if you gets an issue related to some js loads to fail, run truffle.cmd compile)
        - (note: truffle compile should start compiling, otherwise should use truffle.cmd compile)
        

    - truffle migrate or truffle.cmd migrate - This deploys your contract to Ethereum network
        - (note: Please run these commands at the project location)

    - testrpc ususally works on localhost:8545 so we will connect to Ethereum local network in meta mask
    - npm run dev -- [http://localhost:8080/] to run this default structure
    - You can play with MetaCoin Application to understand the flow.
    - You can import accounts of testrpc to metamask using "import Account". This account will also have 100 Ethers.
    - Try to add an account and tramsfer some money from Account 1 (owner) to Account 2. You have to refresh the application 
      to see the META coin balance for the account.


    # IMPORTANT NOTES: I would like to share some important things here
    1. When you run testrpc, you will get a Menonic in the powershell.
    2. copy that  Menonic and open metamask in chrome.
    3. Login using Menonic and set the password. You will receive 100 ETHER if yours testrpc is connected to metamask.
       Also notice that the first address of your testrpc will get added to metamask.
    4. Run truffle compile. It should show you compiling.
    5. truffle migrate should run 1_initial_migrtae.js and 2_deploy_contracts.js
